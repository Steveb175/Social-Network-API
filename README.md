## Usage
This application could be used as a basic starting point for anybody who wants to create an application that focuses on social networking.
  
In order to run the application, first seed the database using "npm run seed." in the shell  
Next, start the application using "npm start" in the shell

From there, the database will be seeded and users will be able to view the usernames input into the database. Using the controllers and routes as references, users can now GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE through Insomnia to change the contents of the database.
